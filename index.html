          Chelsea would not feature in a Champions League final again until the
          2012 final that was being held at the Munich's Allianz Arena. After
          eliminating Napoli, Benfica and Barcelona, Chelsea faced German side
          Bayern Munich, who would be playing the final at their home ground.
          Bayern controlled the game for the most part, and took the lead in the
          83rd minute through Thomas Müller. Didier Drogba equalised five
          minutes later with a header from a corner from Juan Mata. In extra
          time, Bayern missed several opportunities (including a penalty from
          former Chelsea player Arjen Robben) and the game was to be decided
          with a penalty shootout. Chelsea eventually triumphed 4–3, despite
          Juan Mata missing their first penalty. Two Bayern Munich players,
          Ivica Olić and Bastian Schweinsteiger, failed to convert their
          penalties. Drogba scored the final penalty of the shootout to secure
          the Blues' first ever Champions League title.[13] As the title
          holders, Chelsea secured a place in next season's Champions League
          after missing out of qualification, as a result of finishing sixth in
          the Premier League. Nine years after their Champions League triumph,
          Chelsea were able to secure a place in the 2021 final, which was held
          in Estádio do Dragão in Porto against fellow English side Manchester
          City. This was the 3rd time that both English sides will face in the
          final (after 2008 – which Chelsea also involved – and 2019). Despite
          the odds being in Manchester City's favour and City dominated the
          possession throughout the game. Chelsea prevailed and crowned
          Champions of Europe for the second time in club's history after Kai
          Havertz scored the only goal of the match in the 42nd minute, after
          Mason Mount's pass to the him through on goal leading to Havertz
          taking the ball round Manchester City's goalkeeper Ederson, and
          passing it into the net.
